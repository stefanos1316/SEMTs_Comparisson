In order to run jRAPL and monitor a benchmarks energy consumption, one has to 
run the script using the following way: $ ./runBenchmark $1 $2

jRAPL executes EnergyCheckUtils in retrives energy measurements though it,
in order to compile and run EnergyCheckUtils jdk1.8 is required.

Note: Some applications from SPECjvm2008 benchmark suite may not run by using
jdk1.8!
