# SEMTs_Comparisson

This repo contains a number of scripts in order to execute and collect results at different granularities of a system. 
To achieve that, we make use of availabel open source Software Energy Monitoring Tools (SEMTs).
Also, there is a number of different benchmarks and applications, that provide different settings in order to execute them. 
Most of the scripts (found under the script directory) containes information on how to execute them.
